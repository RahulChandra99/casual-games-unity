# Casual-Games

This collection of casual games was created as part of a personal project for practice purposes.

The primary goal of this project is to learn game programming concepts by developing various games. It includes classic games like 2048 and Tic Tac Toe, as well as modern mobile hyper-casual games with diverse mechanics inspired by current trends.

All the games were developed using the Unity Engine with C# and assets sourced from external websites and the Unity Asset Store. Some games are complete, while others are works in progress and are updated periodically.
