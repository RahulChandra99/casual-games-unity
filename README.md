This collection of casual games was created as part of a personal project for practice purposes.

The project's primary goal is to learn game programming concepts by developing various games.

It includes classic games like Minesweeper and Snake, as well as mobile hyper-casual games featuring diverse mechanics based on current trends.

All the games were developed using the Unity Engine with C# and assets sourced from external websites and the Unity Asset Store.

Some games are complete, while others are works in progress and are updated periodically.
